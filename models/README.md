# Trained Models

Download the [CNN/DM Extractive & Rewriter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xE56IheBEcLK9bY-XG6ka9iRyv5LLUNt/view) and extract it into models folder.

It will include:
* GuidAbs.*  - The ContextRewriter trained on CNN/DM.
* SentExt.*  - The BERT-Ext extractive summarizer trained on CNN/DM.
* BERTSUMEXT.* - The BERTSUMEXT extractive originally from [PreSumm](https://github.com/nlpyang/PreSumm).

Then download the Context-scope model trained by me:
