1. I refer to the code of https://github.com/sunyilgdx/NSP-BERT
2. The environments are as follows:
```
Python 3.6
bert4keras 0.10.6
tensorflow-gpu 1.15.0
```
3. The pre-trained BERT model can be downloaded by https://share.weiyun.com/5QOzPqq and you need to use [UER's convert tool](https://github.com/dbiir/UER-py/blob/master/scripts/convert_bert_from_uer_to_original_tf.py) to convert UER pytorch to Original Tensorflow.
